A linked list is a linear data structure that consists of a series of nodes. Each node contains a piece of data and a pointer to the next node in the list. The last node in the list points to a null value. Linked lists are often used because they are efficient to insert and delete elements from.

Here is a diagram of a linked list:
    
    head -> node1 -> node2 -> node3 -> null

In this diagram, the head node is the first node in the list. It contains the data "head" and a pointer to the next node, node1. Node1 contains the data "node1" and a pointer to the next node, node2. Node2 contains the data "node2" and a pointer to the next node, node3. Node3 contains the data "node3" and a pointer to a null value.

Linked lists can be used to implement a variety of data structures, such as stacks, queues, and deques. They can also be used to represent data that is not easily stored in an array, such as a linked list of strings.

**Here are some of the advantages of using linked lists:**

    1. Linked lists are dynamic, meaning that they can be resized as needed.
    2. Linked lists are efficient to insert and delete elements from.
    3. Linked lists can be used to represent data that is not easily stored in an array.

**Here are some of the disadvantages of using linked lists:**

    1. Linked lists can be slower than arrays for accessing elements.
    2. Linked lists can use more memory than arrays.
    3. Linked lists can be more complex to implement than arrays.
