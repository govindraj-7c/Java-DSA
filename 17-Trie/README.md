A trie data structure, also known as a prefix tree or digital tree, is a tree-like data structure that stores strings in a way that allows for efficient retrieval. Tries are commonly used in predictive text or autocomplete dictionaries, and approximate matching algorithms.

Each node in a trie represents a character in a string. The root node represents the empty string, and each child node represents a character that can be appended to the parent node's string.

To insert a string into a trie, we start at the root node and follow the path of characters in the string. If a node for a character does not exist, we create one. Once we reach the end of the string, we mark the node as a terminal node.

To search for a string in a trie, we start at the root node and follow the path of characters in the string. If we reach a terminal node, then the string is present in the trie. Otherwise, the string is not present in the trie.

Tries are a powerful data structure that can be used to efficiently store and retrieve strings. They are commonly used in a variety of applications, such as spell checkers, autocomplete dictionaries, and search engines.
