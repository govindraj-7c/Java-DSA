A hashmap is a data structure that maps keys to values. It is also known as a hash table, associative array, or dictionary. Hashmaps use a hash function to compute an index, also called a hash code, into an array of buckets or slots, from which the desired value can be found. During lookup, the key is hashed and the resulting hash indicates where the corresponding value is stored.

Hashmaps are a very efficient way to store and retrieve data. They are especially useful for storing large amounts of data, as they can provide constant-time access to any element in the map. Hashmaps are also very versatile and can be used to store a variety of data types, including strings, numbers, objects, and even other hashmaps.

Hashmaps are a very powerful data structure that can be used to solve a variety of problems. They are especially useful for storing and retrieving large amounts of data efficiently.
