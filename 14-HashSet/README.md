A HashSet is a collection of items where every item is unique, and it is found in the java.util package. HashSet is a class that extends AbstractSet and implements Set interface. It implements the Set interface, which means that it cannot contain duplicate elements. It is also unordered, which means that the order in which elements are added to the set does not matter.

**Here are some of the features of HashSet:**

    -HashSet stores unique elements.
    -HashSet is implemented using a hash table.
    -HashSet is unsorted.
    -HashSet is unordered.
    -HashSet is efficient for adding, removing, and searching for elements.
