Bit manipulation is a technique that involves manipulating individual bits in a binary representation. In Java, this can be done using bitwise operators. Bitwise operators are operators that operate on individual bits of their operands.

**Bit manipulation can be used for a variety of tasks, such as:**

    1. Checking the value of a specific bit
    2. Setting the value of a specific bit
    3. Clearing the value of a specific bit
    4. Toggling the value of a specific bit
    5. Performing arithmetic operations on binary numbers
    6. Converting binary numbers to other number systems
    7. Converting other number systems to binary numbers
