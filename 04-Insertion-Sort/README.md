Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array one element at a time. While sorting is a simple concept, it is a basic principle used in complex computer programs such as file search, data compression, and path finding.

The algorithm works by building up the sorted list one element at a time. It starts with an empty sorted list and then iterates over the unsorted list, inserting each element into its correct position in the sorted list.

The time complexity of insertion sort is O(n^2) in the worst case, but it is often much faster in practice. This is because insertion sort is an in-place sorting algorithm, which means that it does not require any additional memory.
