Linear search is a method for finding a value in a data structure. It works by checking each element of the data structure one by one until the desired value is found. If the value is not found, the algorithm will return -1.

The linear search algorithm is very simple to implement, but it can be inefficient for large data structures. This is because the algorithm has to check every element of the data structure, even if the desired value is near the beginning.
