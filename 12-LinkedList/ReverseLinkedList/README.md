A linked list is a linear data structure that consists of a sequence of nodes, each containing some data and a reference (or link) to the next node in the sequence. The last node in the sequence has a reference to None (or NULL), indicating that it is the end of the list.

Reversing a linked list means changing the order of the nodes in the list so that the last element becomes the first, the second-to-last becomes the second, and so on. This can be done by iterating through the list and changing the next pointer of each node to point to the previous node.
