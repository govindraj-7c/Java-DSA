A circular linked list is a type of linked list where the last node points back to the first node, creating a continuous loop. This means that there is no end to the list, and you can traverse it indefinitely by starting at any node and following the next pointers.

Circular linked lists are often used in applications where you need to keep track of a sequence of items, but you don't need to know where the beginning or end of the sequence is. For example, a circular linked list can be used to represent a queue, where new items are added to the end of the list and old items are removed from the beginning.

Circular linked lists are a powerful data structure that can be used to solve a variety of problems. If you need to keep track of a sequence of items where the beginning and end of the sequence are not important, a circular linked list is a good choice.
