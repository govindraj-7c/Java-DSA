Heap sort is a sorting algorithm that builds a binary heap data structure from the input array and then repeatedly extracts the largest element from the heap and inserts it into the sorted region. It is a comparison-based sorting algorithm, meaning that it compares elements to determine their order. Heap sort has an average and worst-case time complexity of O(n log n), which makes it a relatively efficient sorting algorithm.

**Here is a step-by-step explanation of how heap sort works:**

    1. Build a binary heap from the input array. A binary heap is a complete binary tree where each parent node is greater than or equal to its child nodes.
    2. Repeatedly extract the largest element from the heap and insert it into the sorted region. This is done by swapping the largest element with the last element in the heap and then heapifying the remaining heap.
    3. Continue steps 2 and 3 until the heap is empty.

Heap sort is a relatively efficient sorting algorithm, but it is not the most efficient sorting algorithm in all cases. Quicksort is generally considered to be the most efficient sorting algorithm, but it can have a worst-case time complexity of O(n^2). Heap sort is a good choice for sorting large arrays where the worst-case time complexity is a concern.
