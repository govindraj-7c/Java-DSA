Quicksort is a sorting algorithm that uses a divide-and-conquer approach to sort an array. It does so by selecting a pivot element and then sorting values larger than it on one side and smaller to the other side, and then it repeats those steps until the array is sorted. It is useful for sorting big data sets.

Quicksort is a very efficient sorting algorithm, and it is often the best choice for sorting large arrays. However, it is important to note that quicksort can be unstable, meaning that the order of equal elements in the array may not be preserved after sorting.
