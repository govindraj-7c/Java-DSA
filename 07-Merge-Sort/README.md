Merge sort is an efficient, general-purpose sorting algorithm. It works by recursively dividing an unsorted list into two halves, sorting each half, and then merging the sorted halves back together. This process is repeated until the entire list is sorted.

Merge sort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm. This means that it breaks down a problem into smaller subproblems, solves the subproblems recursively, and then combines the solutions to the subproblems to solve the original problem.

Merge sort is a stable sorting algorithm. This means that it preserves the relative order of equal elements in the list.

Merge sort has a time complexity of O(n log n), which means that the time it takes to sort a list grows logarithmically with the size of the list. This makes merge sort a very efficient sorting algorithm for large lists.

Merge sort is a very efficient sorting algorithm and is often used in real-world applications. For example, it is used to sort data in databases, spreadsheets, and web pages.
