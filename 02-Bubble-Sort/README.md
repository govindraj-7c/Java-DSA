Bubble sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the input list element by element, comparing the current element with the one after it, swapping their values if needed. These passes through the list are repeated until no swaps have to be performed during a pass, meaning that the list has become fully sorted. The algorithm, which is a comparison sort, is named for the way the larger elements "bubble" up to the top of the list.

Bubble sort is one of the simplest sorting algorithms, and it is often the first sorting algorithm that is taught to students of computer science. It is also a relatively inefficient algorithm, and it is not typically used for sorting large amounts of data. However, bubble sort can be useful for sorting small amounts of data, or for educational purposes.
