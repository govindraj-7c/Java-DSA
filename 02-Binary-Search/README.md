Binary search is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that can be used to find a value in a sorted array. The code first checks if the minimum value is greater than the maximum value. If it is, then the value is not found in the array, and the function returns "Null".

If the minimum value is not greater than the maximum value, then the code calculates the middle index of the array. If the element at the middle index is equal to the value being searched for, then the function returns the index. If the element at the middle index is less than the value being searched for, then the function recursively searches the right half of the array. If the element at the middle index is greater than the value being searched for, then the function recursively searches the left half of the array.

The code continues to recursively search the left or right half of the array until the value is found or the entire array has been searched. If the entire array has been searched and the value has not been found, then the function returns "Null".
